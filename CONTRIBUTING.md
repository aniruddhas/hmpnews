## Getting Started

* Fork the repository on GitHub (It's that easy)
* Create a feature branch based on the development branch.

## Making Changes

* Make changes in your seperate branch.
* Check for unnecessary whitespace with `git diff --check` before committing.
* Make sure your commit messages are easy to understand
* Squash your 'Correcting mistakes' commits if you have a lot of them. (See the 'Squashing Commits' link below)
* Make sure your changes won't affect new users or user without a customised system, try out your changes on a fresh Windows VM to see if it would affect a new user's experience.
  * Sometimes a change that helps you with your cmder experience and tools doesn't always mean other people may need/want it.
